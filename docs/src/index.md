Planar is a sophisticated trading bot framework for running automated trading strategies. It enables interactive experimentation of new strategies through the Julia REPL and their live deployment to trading exchanges with minimal code duplication.

## Core Concepts

The framework is built around the concept of **strategies**. A strategy requires a primary currency representing its balance and a primary exchange where all orders are forwarded and validated.

Writing a Planar strategy is equivalent to writing a Julia module that the bot loads (either dynamically or statically on deployments). Within the module, you import the Planar interface and specialize `call!` entry functions specific to your strategy.

## Architecture and Flexibility

The framework provides extensive convenience and utility functions to manipulate strategy and asset objects across different modules. Planar is highly modular, consisting of almost 30 packages, though most are required for full functionality.

From your strategy, you can manage orders through `call!` functions and expect them to be executed during simulation and live trading (through the CCXT library and other venues) while returning **the same data structures** regardless of execution mode.

### Dispatch System Advantage

Planar's key advantage over trading bots in other languages is its flexibility through Julia's parametric type system. This allows extending the bot by specializing functions for specific scenarios. For example, if an exchange behaves differently, you can specialize the `balance` function for that exchange:

```julia
# Specialize balance function for a specific exchange
balance(exc::Exchange{:MyQuirkyExchange}, args...) = ...
```

where `:MyQuirkyExchange` is the `ExchangeID` symbol of the target exchange.

This dispatch pattern enables:

- Strategy `call!` functions that dispatch based on strategy type parameters
- Zero code duplication between simulation and live trading modes
- Execution mode as a type parameter of the strategy

## Key Capabilities

Planar provides comprehensive tools for:

- **Data Management**: Download, clean, and store market data using popular Julia libraries ([Data](data.md))
- **Time Series Processing**: Resample and manipulate time series data ([Processing](./API/processing.md))
- **Live Data Tracking**: Monitor tickers, trades, and OHLCV data ([Watchers](watchers/watchers.md))
- **Performance Analysis**: Compute statistics about backtest runs ([Metrics](metrics.md))
- **Visualization**: Generate interactive plots for OHLCV data, indicators, and backtesting results ([Plotting](plotting.md))
- **Parameter Optimization**: Optimize strategy parameters ([Optimization](optimization.md))

## Installation

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

The recommended installation method is through Docker. Four images are available:

| Configuration | Precompiled 🧰 | Sysimage 📦 |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Runtime Only 🖥️ | `planar-precomp` | `planar-sysimage` |
| With Plotting & Optimization 📊 | `planar-precomp-interactive` | `planar-sysimage-interactive` |

**Image Characteristics**:
- **Precompiled**: Smaller, more flexible, slower startup
- **Sysimage**: Larger, potential compatibility issues, faster startup

```bash
# Pull and run the precompiled image
docker pull docker.io/psydyllic/planar-precomp
docker run -it --rm docker.io/psydyllic/planar-precomp julia

# Load Planar in Julia
using Planar  # or PlanarInteractive for plotting and optimization
```

### Source Installation

**Requirements**: Julia 1.11+ (Planar is not in the Julia registry)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/psydyllic/Planar.jl
   cd Planar.jl
   ```

2. **Set up environment**:
   ```bash
   # Review and enable environment variables
   direnv allow
   ```

3. **Start Julia and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   julia  # Uses JULIA_PROJECT from .envrc
   ```
   
   ```julia
   # In Julia REPL
   ] instantiate
   using Planar  # or PlanarInteractive for plotting and optimization
   ```

## Quick Example

For experienced users, here's the essential workflow to get started immediately:

### 1. Load Strategy

```julia
using Planar

@environment!  # Bring modules into scope

# Load default strategy (see ./user/strategies/SimpleStrategy/ or create your own)
s = strategy(:SimpleStrategy, exchange=:binance)
```

### 2. Download Data

```julia
# Download last 1000 candles from strategy exchange
fetch_ohlcv(s, from=-1000)
```

### 3. Load and Backtest

```julia
# Load data into strategy universe
load_ohlcv(s)

# Run backtest for available data period
start!(s)
```

### 4. Visualize Results

```julia
using Plotting
using WGLMakie  # or GLMakie

plots!()  # or Pkg.activate("PlanarInteractive"); using PlanarInteractive
balloons(s)  # Plot simulated trades
```
